  /// Use allow_incomplete to create subscriptions with status=incomplete if the first invoice cannot be paid. Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the SCA Migration Guide for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.
  ///
  /// Use default_incomplete to create Subscriptions with status=incomplete when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to status=active when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, SCA regulation, or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to status=incomplete_expired, which is a terminal state.
  ///
  /// Use error_if_incomplete if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription’s first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the changelog to learn more.
